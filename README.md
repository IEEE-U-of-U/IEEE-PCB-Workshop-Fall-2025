# IEEE PCB Workshop Fall 2025

## Introduction
Welcome to the IEEE PCB Workshop Series for Fall 2025 at the University of Utah!

## General Information

We will be hosting this workshop over 8-9 weeks this semester, currently scheduled for **Wednesdays at 4:10 PM to 5:30 PM** beginning September 3rd and ending November 12th (see tentative schedule below). Sessions may go overtime to 6:00 PM depending on the topic covered. To help alleviate these longer sessions, food may be provided (tentatively planned). All planned dates are shown below.

The workshops will be held in **WEB L102** unless otherwise specified.

We will be presenting a design for a *USB-C Breadboard Power Supply* and all participants are invited to participate in designing, manufacturing, and assembling their own PCBs, which they will be able to keep at the end.

__Workshop Goals__

- Introduction to PCB design
- Introduction to ECAD software (Altium, KiCAD)
- Introduction to Schematic Layout
- Introduction to PCB Layout
- Basics of PCB Manufacturing
- Introduction to Soldering
- Introduction to Verification and Debugging

## ECAD Software

### ALTIUM Designer (Highly Recommended)
Altium is the software that is going to be desmonstrated during the workshop and will be the easiest to follow along. All resources provided will be natively supported in Altium Designer.

If you plan to use Altium, please complete the instructions for registering and installing Altium on a personal machine. This allows us to immediately begin our workshop sessions without troubleshooting.

### KiCAD

Please install KiCAD if you are not using Altium. While we do support this program, as KiCAD can import Altium files, we will be focusing on Altium Designer.
